Wonderful8Coin - W8

Wonderful8Coin is a X13, PoW/PoS coin that provides super awarded blocks based on the hash. The normal payout of each block is 88 coins. If the hash contains 6-8 8s (about 5% depends on the genesis block), the payout will increase to 888 coins. If 9 or more 8s in the hash (about 1%), then 8888 coins are paid.

Wonderful8Coin uses true randomness, so multipools or those with huge hash power can not get more advantages. The coin uses PoW/PoS separation technologies so it provides faster transactions.
